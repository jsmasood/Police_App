# Police Data Visualization Application

Improving public service delivery is one of the major challenges faced by governments in developing countries. However the spread of computers and technology has given us the tools to redevelop systems and tackle these problems in new and innovative ways.

This project studies the problems faced by the Punjab Police in managing and understanding their crime data, and aims to provide an application to help them collect and visualize crime reports. It will include a database component, a charting component and a mapping component to help store data and create graphics from it.

The project will provide insight into both the workings of the Punjab Police and how to create applications for the public sector.
